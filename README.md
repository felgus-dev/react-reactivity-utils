# react-reactivity-utils

## ALPHA EXPERIMENTAL VERSION, DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION

A small, reliable and easy to use react utilities to help you improve the reactivity in your applications.

React uses a coarse-grain reactivity model, and there are some gaps in the conceptual system, what
we try to fill with these utils. Using them, you avoid common wronge usages of `useEffect` and improve
your code redability and performance.
